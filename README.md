I‚Äôm an indie Senior Software/DevOps Engineer who find myself with building solutions that address everyday challenges.

I code frequently on Github to share my results based on the goals and visions I have in open-source world and concept of sharing.

I have a weekly newsletter that you should check out! In it, I share what's new and cool in the world of software development, stories, lesson learned, stir and more.
If you‚Äôd like to discuss these or anything tech-related, feel free to join and follow me on following platforms. I typically write on my personal blog or Medium when I‚Äôm in a writing mood to express more of my thought streams.
